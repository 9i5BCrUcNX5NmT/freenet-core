## The Internet's dangerous design flaw

In the early days of the Internet, each computer had an IP address and could
establish connections with others, resembling a peer-to-peer network. However,
as the Internet evolved, centralized client-server architectures became the
norm, with HTTP, SMTP, and FTP protocols dominating the scene. Among these,
HTTP has emerged as the most widely used, overshadowing the others.

While this centralized approach initially posed little risk, over time, it has
enabled a few large companies to amass an alarming amount of power. Although
these companies were initially neutral platforms, they have increasingly used
their power to censor and punish users, often in collaboration with
governments. This concentration of power poses an existential threat to
democracy and freedom of speech.

To address this issue we're building a new Freenet, an alternative to the
client-server oligarchy, a decentralized platform that empowers users and
serves their interests, rather than those of the powerful.

## Our solution: A new Freenet

Freenet is software that runs on your computer and gives you access to an
alternate decentralized Internet, but using familiar tools like web browsers.
