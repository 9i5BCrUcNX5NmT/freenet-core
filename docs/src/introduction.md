# Introduction

The internet has revolutionized the way we live our lives, forging connections
and facilitating communication on a global scale. Since its inception in the
1960s and widespread adoption in the 1990s, the internet has transformed our
world, enabling us to access information and interact with people from all
corners of the globe.

However as it grew the Internet become much more centralized, with a few large
corporations holding unprecedented power over users. Worsening over time, these
corporations have abused their power to censor, manipulate, and exclude people
from services that have become essential to modern life. To address this
growing concern, a new decentralized internet is necessary to ensure that tools
serve the users and not the interests of large corporations.

Our aim is to create a decentralized internet on top of the existing
infrastructure that utilizes the Internet Protocol (IP), which is inherently
decentralized. We recognize that the ease of use has always been a limiting
factor in democratizing tools, but we plan to overcome this challenge by using
existing tools that we are familiar with, such as browsers, HTML, JavaScript,
and more. 

A fresh approach to solving age-old problems, such as spam, is possible with
the creation of a new decentralized internet. Existing solutions, like
Captchas, have proven to be ineffective as they are easy to bypass. By building
a new decentralized internet, we can reclaim our freedom to communicate from
tech oligarchs, ensuring that we have access to a free and open internet that
serves its users.
