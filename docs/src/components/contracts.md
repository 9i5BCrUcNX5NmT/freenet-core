## Contracts

<!-- toc -->

### Overview

Contracts in Freenet are [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) components that
manage and regulate public state. They can be likened to inodes in a filesystem,
tables in a database, or memory locations in a globally shared memory. Contracts
define the circumstances under which state can be modified and whether a given
state is permitted.

Contracts can also act as realtiem communication conduits between
[delegates](delegates.md) and [user interfaces](ui.md).

Contracts and their corresponding state reside on the Freenet network on peers
determined by the contract's location, which is derived from its WebAssembly
code and parameters. While a user's delegates are hosted on their local Freenet
peer, contracts are hosted on the network and their state is publicly readable.

Each contract is identified by a cryptographic hash, generated from a
combination of its code and parameters, also referred to as its "key". This key
is used to identify the contract and to verify that the contract's code and
parameters have not been tampered with.

## Contract Operation

### State synchronization and merging

#### Fundamental Concepts

Contracts need to provide a mechanism to merge any two valid states, creating a
new state that integrates both. This process ensures the eventual consistency of
contract states in Freenet, a concept similar to Conflict-free Replicated Data Types
(CRDTs).

In the language of mathematics, the contract outlines a commutative monoid on
the contract's state. For example, if the contract's state is a single number,
then the contract could define the merging of two states as the sum of the two
numbers. However, these basic operations are too simple on their own but can be
combined with others to support the merging of more complex states.

#### Efficient State Synchronization

Efficiency in state synchronization is key. A na√Øve approach would be to provide
a single function that takes two states and returns a merged state. However,
this would be inefficient, as it necessitates the entire state to be transferred
between peers. Instead, Freenet contracts employ three functions:
`summarize_state`, `get_state_delta`, and `update_state`. Together, these functions
allow states to be synchronized efficiently between peers.

### Contract Use Cases

Consider a public blog contract. The state of this contract would be the blog's
content, including a list of blog posts. The contract's code stipulates that new
posts can only be added if they are signed by the blog's owner, with the owner's
public key included in the contract's parameters.

In this scenario, the contract's code would define the merging of two states as
taking the union of the two lists of posts. A maximum limit could be imposed on
the number of posts maintained in the state, with the oldest posts being removed
first.

### Writing a Contract in Rust

#### The `ContractInterface` Trait

Rust contracts must implement the `ContractInterface` trait, which defines the
functions that the kernel calls to interact with the contract. This trait is
defined in the [locutus-stdlib](https://github.com/freenet/locutus/blob/main/crates/locutus-stdlib/src/contract_interface.rs#L424).

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../crates/locutus-stdlib/src/contract_interface.rs:contractifce}}
```
